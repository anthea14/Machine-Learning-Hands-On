#My 30-Day ML Hands-on Challenge🚀 
Hey! I'm doing this 30-day challenge where I code one ML algorithm every day - full EDA, training, evaluation, all in Python. Starting with linear regression, ten logistic regression, decision trees, up to the advanced ones.

Just pure coding practice. College teaches theory but I need hands-on reps to actually fully understand and implement ML. Daily 2-3 hour sessions = real muscle memory for algorithms, so when I build actual projects later, I'll know exactly what I'm doing.

Simple plan: Notebook → commit → next algo. 30 days from zero to confident.
